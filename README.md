# Project: Corner-Grocer 
Create a C++ code that allows users to chose to input a word(s) found on a text file, read through a text file to locate the word(s), then output the word(s) and number of times it is found in the text file.

What did you do particularly well?

What I did very well is try, try, and try again to find a way to get this code to work. After many hours of trial and error, I found that the first and most important step was to create a code that reads the text file. Then make additions to the code based on the instructions given in the assignment.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Since options 2 and 3 are basically variations of option 1, I would like to look for a way to make the code more efficient with option 2 and 3. Also, I plan to rewrite the code in Python, incorporate machine learning, and find additional insights in the data.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the code was determining the right items to include in the header section. Primarily because the purpose of the header section is to include the necessary C++ libraries and declarations for the program to compile and run successfully. It also provides access to identifiers and functions from the libraries that are needed for the program. 

The resources that helped the most were the Zybooks lessons that covered areas of this assignment.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Certainly, reading a text file and allowing a user visualize the data, is the most transferable part of this project. This skill would be the most useful in a real world setting and could help an organization find data-based solutions.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The code was built in Visual Studio and saved in a One Drive zip folder. So, its only fair to say that Microsoft played a huge part in giving me the ability to maintain, read, and adapt this code.
